          What are the functionalities of pedigrees and Punnett squares?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          These two visual concepts are an integral part of most biology courses taught from the secondary school level and up, and gaining an understanding of how genetics works through a visual aid can be a boon for most teachers. In addition, pedigrees and Punnett squares are an effective tool for users to determine likelihood of diseases being passed from parent to child.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pedigrees focus on displaying the relationships within a family, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "macro" scale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Punnett squares focus on displaying possible offspring that may be produced when two parents have a child, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "micro" scale.

      <h2>Pedigree</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Pedigree supports the most common mode of inheritance, autosomal recessive.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          Why is knowing the carrier probability significant?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          A carrier does not exhibit the recessive phenotype, but he/she carries the recessive allele. An offspring of two carriers is thus at risk of inheriting two recessive alleles and exhibiting the diseased phenotype. 
          <br>
          <br>
          By knowing the probability of an individual being a carrier, informed conclusions can be drawn regarding the likelihood of his/her children being afflicted with a disease.

        <div class="question">
          How do I calculate the probability of two parents having an infected child in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Using the pedigree, you can determine the most likely genotype of each parent (a purely unaffected parent has genotype AA; a carrier parent has genotype Aa; an infected parent has genotype aa). You may then utilize these genotypes in the Punnett square function to determine the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

      <h2> Punnett Square</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What are the different Punnett square sizes?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Punnett square supports three sizes: 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, and 16x16. Each size determines the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes for a different number of traits. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <u>2x2</u>: One trait <br>
          <u>4x4</u>: Two traits <br>
          <u>8x8</u>: Three traits <br>
          <u>16x16</u>: Four traits <br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What do <i>AA</i>, <i>Aa</i>, and <i>aa</i> mean?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          A parent genotype can take one of three forms: homozygous dominant (AA), heterozygous (Aa), or homozygous recessive (aa). The corresponding phenotype can be determined upon deciding the mode of inheritance.

        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Punnett square supports three modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, codominance, and incomplete dominance.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          How are these modes of inheritance different?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <u>Autosomal</u>: The dominant phenotype <strong>only</strong> will be expressed as long as at least one dominant allele is inherited (genotype AA or Aa). This is represented with a fully shaded cell.<br><br>
          <u>Codominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), both the dominant <strong>and</strong> the recessive phenotypes will be expressed. This is represented with a half-shaded cell.<br><br>
          <u>Incomplete Dominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), the phenotype will be an <strong>intermediate</strong> of dominant and recessive. This is represented with a lightly shaded cell.
