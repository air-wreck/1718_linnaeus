          What are the functionalities of pedigrees and Punnett squares?
        </div><br>
        <div class="answer">
          These two visual concepts are an integral part of most biology courses taught from the secondary school level and up, and gaining an understanding of how genetics works through a visual aid can be a boon for most teachers. In addition, pedigrees and Punnett squares are an effective tool for users to determine likelihood of diseases being passed from parent to child. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Pedigrees focus on displaying the relationships within a family, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "macro" scale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Punnett squares focus on displaying possible offspring that may be produced when two parents have a child, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "micro" scale.

      <h2>Pedigree</h2>

        <div class="question">
          How do I calculate the probability of two parents having an infected child in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Using the pedigree, you can determine the most likely genotype of each parent (a purely unaffected parent has genotype AA; a carrier parent has genotype Aa; an infected parent has genotype aa). You may then utilize these genotypes in the Punnett square function to determine the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

          What modes of inheritance are supported?

        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Pedigree supports the most common mode of inheritance, autosomal 
            recessive.

        <u>Autosomal</u>: The dominant phenotype <strong>only</strong> will be expressed as long as at least one dominant allele is inherited (genotype AA or Aa). This is represented with a fully shaded cell.<br><br>
        <u>Codominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), both the dominant <strong>and</strong> the recessive phenotypes will be expressed. This is represented with a half-shaded cell.<br><br>
        <u>Incomplete Dominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), the phenotype will be an <strong>intermediate</strong> of dominant and recessive. This is represented with a lightly shaded cell.
