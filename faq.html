          What are the functionalities of pedigrees and Punnett squares?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          These two visual concepts are an integral part of most biology courses taught from the secondary school level and up, and gaining an understanding of how genetics works through a visual aid can be a boon for most teachers. In addition, pedigrees and Punnett squares are an effective tool for users to determine likelihood of diseases being passed from parent to child.

          Pedigrees focus on displaying the relationships within a family, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "macro" scale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Punnett squares focus on displaying possible offspring that may be produced when two parents have a child, and are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "micro" scale.

      <h2>Pedigree</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          How do I calculate the probability of two parents having an infected child in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Using the pedigree, you can determine the most likely genotype of each parent (a purely unaffected parent has genotype AA; a carrier parent has genotype Aa; an infected parent has genotype aa). You may then utilize these genotypes in the Punnett square function to determine the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Pedigree supports the most common mode of inheritance, autosomal recessive.
        </div>

      <h2> Punnett Square</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Punnett square supports three modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, codominance, and incomplete dominance.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          How are these modes of inheritance different?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <u>Autosomal</u>: The dominant phenotype <strong>only</strong> will be expressed as long as at least one dominant allele is inherited (genotype AA or Aa). This is represented with a fully shaded cell.<br><br>
          <u>Codominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), both the dominant <strong>and</strong> the recessive phenotypes will be expressed. This is represented with a half-shaded cell.<br><br>
          <u>Incomplete Dominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), the phenotype will be an <strong>intermediate</strong> of dominant and recessive. This is represented with a lightly shaded cell.
