        <div class="question">
          What are the functionalities of pedigrees and Punnett squares?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          These two visual concepts are an integral part of most biology
          courses taught from the secondary school level and up, and gaining an
          understanding of how genetics works through a visual aid can be a
          boon for most teachers. In addition, pedigrees and Punnett squares
          are an effective tool for users to determine likelihood of diseases
          being passed from parent to child.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pedigrees focus on displaying the relationships within a family, and
          are effective to look at genetic inheritance on a "macro" scale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Punnett squares focus on displaying possible offspring that may be
          produced when two parents have a child, and are effective to look at
          genetic inheritance on a "micro" scale.

        <div class="question">
          How can I save a pedigree or Punnett square that I have been working
          on?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Click the "Download Data/CSV" button to save a current work file. To
          edit, simply reupload the file using the "Upload Data" button.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, a pedigree or Punnett square can be saved as an image
          by clicking the "Download as Image" button.
          <br>
          <br>
          Note that in order to keep the downloaded CSV as clean as possible,
          the information about the inheritance mode is contained within the
          filename for Punnett square CSV files. This means that you should not
          rename these files.

        <div class="question">
          Where can I learn more about the basic genetic concepts used in
          Linnaeus?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Most of the biological concepts in Linnaeus require only a high
          school-level class to understand. If you are unfamiliar with concepts
          like genotypes, dominant traits, or Mendelian inheritance, you may
          find it useful to consult a high school textbook or an online
          educational resource like Khan Academy before using Linnaeus.

        <div class="question">
          Is Linnaeus free software/open source?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Although we love free software, Linnaeus is unfortunately
          closed-source. This is because it is being developed as a school
          project, and sharing the source code would constitute a violation of
          academic integrity (especially if others contribute). Perhaps
          Linnaeus will become free software once we have finished the CSE
          course.

        <div class="question">
          I downloaded an image/data file, but the image/data therein differs
          from that on my screen. Why did this happen?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          This is likely caused by forgetting to click "solve"/"build" before
          downloading the file. The file downloads will take whatever pedigree
          or Punnett square is <em>currently</em> rendered on the screen,
          so you will need to "refresh" the view by solving each configuration
          before downloading.

      <!-- pedigree FAQs -->
      <h2>Pedigree</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Pedigree supports the most common mode of inheritance,
          autosomal recessive.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          Why is knowing the carrier probability significant?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          A carrier does not exhibit the recessive phenotype, but he/she
          carries the recessive allele. An offspring of two carriers is thus at
          risk of inheriting two recessive alleles and exhibiting the diseased
          phenotype.
          <br>
          <br>
          By knowing the probability of an individual being a carrier, informed
          conclusions can be drawn regarding the likelihood of his/her children
          being afflicted with a disease.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          How do I calculate the probability of two parents having an infected
          child in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Using the pedigree, you can determine the most likely genotype of
          each parent (a purely unaffected parent has genotype AA; a carrier
          parent has genotype Aa; an infected parent has genotype aa). You may
          then utilize these genotypes in the Punnett square function to
          determine the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

      <!-- Punnett square FAQs -->
      <h2> Punnett Square</h2>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What are the different Punnett square sizes?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Punnett square supports four sizes: 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, and
          16x16. Each size determines the possible offspring genotypes and
          phenotypes for a different number of traits.
          <br>
          <br>
          <u>2x2</u>: One trait <br>
          <u>4x4</u>: Two traits <br>
          <u>8x8</u>: Three traits <br>
          <u>16x16</u>: Four traits <br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What do <i>AA</i>, <i>Aa</i>, and <i>aa</i> mean?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          A parent genotype can take one of three forms: homozygous dominant
          (AA), heterozygous (Aa), or homozygous recessive (aa). The
          corresponding phenotype can be determined upon deciding the mode of
          inheritance.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          What modes of inheritance are supported?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Linnaeus Punnett square supports three modes of inheritance:
          autosomal dominant, codominance, and incomplete dominance. Only
          autosomal dominant is supported for large (4x4, 8x8, and 16x16)
          Punnett squares.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-wrapper">
        <div class="question">
          How are these modes of inheritance different?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <u>Autosomal</u>: The dominant phenotype <strong>only</strong> will
          be expressed as long as at least one dominant allele is inherited
          (genotype AA or Aa). This is represented with a fully shaded
          cell.<br><br>
          <u>Codominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the recessive
          allele are present (genotype Aa), both the dominant
          <strong>and</strong> the recessive phenotypes will be expressed. This
          is represented with a half-shaded cell.<br><br>
          <u>Incomplete Dominance</u>: If both the dominant allele and the
          recessive allele are present (genotype Aa), the phenotype will be an
          <strong>intermediate</strong> of dominant and recessive. This is
          represented with a lightly shaded cell.
