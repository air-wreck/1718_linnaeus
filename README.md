# 1718_linnaeus
CSE 2017-18 final project by Nelson, Karena and Eric

### introduction
Biology is the world around us. This is therefore a very powerful tool for the
world around us.

### dependencies
This software requires the Python packages `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and
`graphviz`. `numpy` is already a dependency of `matplotlib`, so you likely do
not need to install it separately. For `graphviz`, you will need to install
both the actual program and the Python bindings. You can find installation
instructions for your specific system here:

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [graphviz Python](http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)
* [graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/)
